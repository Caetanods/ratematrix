\description{
Gerate a list of prior functions for the log density of the evolutionary rate matrix and phylogenetic mean.
}
\details{
The prior for the evolutionary rate matrix uses the separation strategy (Barnard et al, 2000).
    This strategy creates a marginally uniform prior by modelling the covariance matrix using a
    correlation matrix and a vector of variance coeficients. One can also use a inverse Wishart prior,
    however the inverse Wishart is a very informative prior and need to be explored with caution.\cr
\cr
The prior on the phylogenetic mean (root value) is a multivariate normal distribution with mean vector
    'mu' and variance vector 'sd'.
